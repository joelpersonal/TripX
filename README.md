- Seasonal optimization
- Safety and popularity metrics
- Climate and activity preferences

##  Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Advanced Recommendation Algorithm
```python
# Multi-factor weighted scoring system
scoring_weights = {
    'budget_fit': 0.3,
    'duration_fit': 0.2, 
    'trip_type_match': 0.25,
    'season_match': 0.15,
    'quality_bonus': 0.1
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Feature Engineering
- Cost categorization with budget compatibility scoring
- Duration range optimization algorithms
- Trip type compatibility matrix
- Seasonal preference matching
- Quality scoring (popularity + safety weighted)

### 3. Hybrid AI Architecture
- **ML Core**: Authoritative decision-making engine
- **LLM Layer**: Natural language explanation generation
- **API Enrichment**: Real-time data integration
- **Strict Separation**: Each component has defined responsibilities


## System Performance

**Recommendation Accuracy**: Multi-stage filtering with weighted scoring
**Processing Speed**: Real-time recommendation generation
**Scalability**: Modular architecture supporting dataset expansion
**User Experience**: Intuitive interface with comprehensive explanations
